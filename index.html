					Come closer to the fire, child, and listen well, for this is not a

				<h2>The Six Realms</h2>
				<div id="region">
					<img style="width: 40%" src="./images/Grundwyn.jpg" />
					<p>
						<strong>🌳 Grundwyn — The Realm of Greenwood</strong> — In Grundwyn
						dwelt the <b>Wood Elves</b>, proud and mighty in magic, their voices
						weaving storms, their arrows faster than the wind. With them came
						<b>the First Men</b>, castaways from distant seas, who bent knee to
						elven lords and learned their ways. Together they forged uneasy
						bonds: elves shaping sorcery from root and star, men shaping stone
						and steel into fortresses beneath the green canopy.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="region">
					<p>
						<strong>⛰️ Elenor — The Hollow Mountains</strong> — Elenor, the
						hollow mountains, glittering with forges and deep halls. This was
						the realm of the <b>Dwarves</b>, masters of craft. Few in number,
						yet their armor gleamed like the sun, and their engines roared with
						power no other race could match. Their cannons spat thunder, their
						axes split stone, and their greed for the earth’s treasures was as
						endless as the mines they dug.
					</p>
					<img style="width: 40%" src="./images/Elanor.jpg" />

				<div id="region">
					<img style="width: 40%" src="./images/Vornak.jpg" />
					<p>
						<strong>🐉 Vornak — The Drowned Realm</strong> — Vornak, the drowned
						swamps, steaming with mist and secrets. Here, among black waters and
						tangled roots, the <b>Goblins</b> reigned. Countless were their
						numbers, fierce their spirit. They knew the herbs that could cheat
						death itself, plucking life back from the edge of the grave.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					<strong>❄️ Skjölend — The Frozen Edge </strong> — Skjölend, the frozen
					isles at the world’s edge. A land of eternal frost, where
					<b>Giants</b>
					strode, vast and terrible, alongside mammoths and white bears born of
					the ice. It was a place of titans, where storms howled like living
					beasts, and only the strong endured. Those who walked Skjölend carried
					the strength of the mountain in their bones — though now, their kind
					has vanished into legend, leaving only empty peaks and whispers in the
					snow.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>☀️ Dun’vahr — The Golden Expanse</strong> — Dun’vahr, a sea of
					golden sand, vast and empty beneath the burning sun. The coasts were
					not empty though. There, hidden among jagged cliffs and salt caves,
					<b>smugglers and pirates</b> carved their lairs. They were wolves
					without a master, striking at passing ships, vanishing into the sands.
					Dun’vahr was no empire — only a wound in the world, a place of pirates
					and thieves.

						— And last, <b>The Shattered Shoals</b> — broken coasts and jagged
						isles, forever lashed by storm and sea. Here ruled the
						<b>Dark Elves</b>, cloaked in silence. Their black spires clung to
						cliffs of obsidian, their eyes turned ever inward, guarding a secret
						greater than kingdoms: the <b>Ebony Ice</b>.
						<br />
						This crystal was no mere stone, but the soul of eternity. It drank
						the spirits of the dead and bound them within its frozen heart,
						granting power unending — power to forge weapons that burned with
						soul-fire, to shape machines that defied nature itself. Yet each
						shard whispered madness, corrupting all who dared wield it. Only the
						Dark Elves could master it. Only they could guard it. And guard it
						they did, in cold silence, while the other realms schemed and bled.

				<h2>The Temptation of Ebony Ice</h2>
				<p>
					And it was these pirates who first carried whispers of a strange black
					crystal, taken from the Shattered Shoals. Whispers grew into rumors,
					and rumors into fire — until across Nyvarra, kings and councils turned
					their gaze toward the dark elf realm.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The Wood Elves of Grundwyn</b>, masters of sorcery, grew restless.
					Proud and but not eternal, they dreamed of wielding Ebony Ice to bend
					life and death itself, to command storms, to reign without end. To
					them, it was not treasure — it was destiny.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The First Men</b>, a small host of exiles dwelling beneath the
					Elves’ boughs, weaker than all others yet fierce in spirit, saw in the
					Ice a chance to carve themselves into history. They dreamed of
					returning to their lost heartland with weapons unstoppable, and to
					avenge the shame of their exile.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The Goblins of Vornak</b>, countless as swarms, hungered for it as
					an ingredient of immortality. To them, it was not crystal but a seed —
					a seed to graft into their herbs and brews, to make flesh endure
					beyond time, to cheat death itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The Dwarves of Elenor</b>, proud lords of forge and stone, hungered
					with a fire unlike the rest. To them, the Ebony Ice was not treasure
					but fuel — the ultimate heart for their engines of war, a spark to
					turn their forges into suns. They dreamed of earth-eaters, iron
					leviathans that could grind mountains to dust and march with armies of
					flame. In their secret councils, they whispered of
					<b>Skjölend</b> itself, and how one day their machines would devour
					even the frozen isles for more earth to feed their hunger.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each race saw in the Ice crystals not what it was, but what they
					desired most.
				</p>
				<p>
					And so, though they were never friends, they forged an
					<b>alliance of greed</b>.
				</p>
				<i>
					<blockquote>
						“Why,” they whispered, “should such power lie in the hands of one
						realm, when together we can seize it? The Dark Elves are few,
						silent, withdrawn. Let us strike as one, and the Ebony Ice will be
						ours to share.”
					</blockquote>
				</i>
				<div id="imageFrame">
					<img style="width: 500px" src="./images/The Covenant of Greed.jpg" />
					<small>Fig: The Covenant of Greed</small>
				</div>
				<p>
					Thus was born the <b>doomed covenant</b> — Goblins, Dwarves, Wood
					Elves, and First Men bound by a single dream: to wrest the heart of
					eternity from the Shoals.
				</p>
				<p>And in their unity was planted the seed of their ruin.</p>
			</article>

			<article id="war" class="chapter">
				<h2>The War of Ash and Silence</h2>
				<p>
					So it began — Goblins, Dwarves, Wood Elves, and the First Men — bound
					themselves in oath, swearing to seize the Ebony Ice from the Dark
					Elves of the Shoals. <br />They called it a pact of hope. <br />But
					the world remembers it as a covenant of doom.

				</div>

				<h3>🌳 The Wrath of the Wood Elves</h3>
				<p>
					First to strike were the <b>Wood Elves of Grundwyn</b>. With voices
					raised in sorcery, they called tempests to shatter cliffs and forests
					of thorn to pierce stone walls. Lightning danced upon their arrows,
					storms obeyed their command. Their pride was fire, and their fire
					burned brightest of all.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet with every spell, the Ebony Ice stirred. The air grew heavy. The
					earth grew weary. And in their triumphs, they sowed their undoing.
				</p>
				<h3>🪓 The Thunder of the Dwarves</h3>
				<p>
					Beside them marched the <b>Dwarves of Elenor</b>, clad in armor that
					gleamed like dawn, engines of war roaring like thunder. Their forges
					birthed cannons that could crack a mountain, and earth-eaters that
					tore through fortresses like paper.
				</p>
				<div id="region">
					<div id="imageFrame">
						<img style="width: 200px" src="./images/seige begin.jpg" />
						<small>Fig: The Seige</small>
					</div>
					<p>
						They struck the Shoals with fire and iron, but for every stone they
						shattered, the sea swallowed more. And in their greed, the Dwarves
						dug too deep into the crystal veins. Their engines drank of the Ice,
						and when they roared, they roared with the screams of the damned.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3>🐉 The Endless Horde of the Goblins</h3>
				<p>
					From the swamps of Vornak came the <b>Goblins</b>, a tide without end.
					Ten thousand, twenty, more — they poured upon the Shoals like locusts.
					Their shamans brewed Ebony Ice into their potions, and for a time they
					fought as demons, tireless, fearless, immortal.
				</p>
				<p>
					But immortality was a lie. The Ice consumed them. Flesh twisted, eyes
					burned, souls unravelled. What had been a horde became a plague of
					madness. The Shoals were drowned in their screams.
				</p>
				<h3>⚔️ The Desperation of the First Men</h3>
				<p>
					And last came the <b>First Men</b>. Few in number compared to the
					others, yet burning with fury. They carried no sorcery, no engines, no
					potions — only steel and unyielding will. They struck at night,
					desperate to prove themselves, desperate to carve a name.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a moment, it seemed they would. For a moment, the First Men stood
					upon the cliffs of the Shoals, Ebony Ice glittering in their reach.
					But the closer they came, the heavier their hearts grew, as though the
					crystal weighed upon their very souls.
				</p>
				<p>
					And when the Dark Elves came, the First Men were the first to break.
				</p>
				<h3>🌑 The Silence Descends</h3>
				<p>
					From the black cliffs they emerged: the
					<b>Dark Elves of the Shoals</b>. Cloaked in silence, their eyes like
					cold stars, they descended not as an army but as judgment itself. They
					wielded no banners, sang no songs. Their blades carved through
					enchantment, their shadows swallowed flame.
				</p>
				<p>
					Against them, the alliance shattered. Goblins turned upon Goblins,
					Dwarves’ engines crumbled, Elves fell screaming to their own storms.
					The First Men fled across the sea, their ships vanishing into mist.
				</p>
				<p>And when the silence lifted, the war was ended.</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>🕯️ The Ashes of Alliance</h3>
				<p>
					The <b>Goblins</b> were broken, back in Vornak, their burrows cursed
					and filled with darker things. The <b>Dwarves</b> were undone, their
					halls hollow and haunted. The <b>Wood Elves</b> scattered, never again
					to gather in such strength. The <b>First Men</b> vanished into the
					mist, leaving only one bloodline — House Hornn — to return in later
					ages
				</p>
				<p>
					The land itself bore scars: forests turned to cinders, mountains
					split, seas fouled with ash. For a hundred years, Nyvarra starved
					beneath the shadow of what its peoples had unleashed.
				</p>
				<p>
					And so it was named <b><i>"The War of Ash and Silence"</i></b
					>. Ash, for the ruin it left. Silence, for the judgment of the Dark
					Elves, who spoke no word but ended all with gaze.
				</p>
				<h3>🌫️ The Treaty of Ozvark</h3>
				<p>
					When the slaughter was done, <b>Ozvark</b> the
					<i>High Maester of the Dark Elven council</i> summoned what remained
					of the broken Kings and Queens. Upon the cliffs of the Shoals, he
					compelled them to swear a covenant: never again would the realms raise
					war upon The Shatterd Shoals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those who broke this oath, he warned, would not merely fall — they
					would vanish from memory, their names stripped from song and stone
					alike.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus the Shattered Shoals became <b>Ozvark</b>, and its name was
					written in silence upon every tongue.
				</p>
				<p>
					The War of Ash and Silence left not only corpses and ruins — it left
					scars upon the very bones of Nyvarra. What followed was an age darker
					still, known in song and dread as…

				<h2>The Veilfall Period</h2>
				<div id="region">
					<p>
						When the Ebony Ice cracked beneath blood and greed, it screamed. Its
						shards drank deep of souls, then bled them back into the world like
						a wound that would not heal.
						<br />
						Forests charred, rivers turned black, carrying whispers instead of
						water.<br />
						Mountains groaned as if alive, pale shadows that walked like men.
						<br />
						This was the <b>Veilfall period</b>, an age when the veil between
						living and dead tore open.

				<hr />
				<h3>👹 The Goblins’ Curse</h3>
				<p>
					The Goblins, who had once been endless as the reeds of Vornak, were
					the first to suffer. Their burrows, swollen with Ebony Ice, became
					maws of horror. From the dark pits came creatures not Goblin, not
					beast, not even of Nyvarra. The few survivors fled into swamps,
					dwindling, becoming shadows of the hordes they once were.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some say even now, in the deepest mire of Vornak, you can hear the
					echoes of their madness — Goblin voices still howling for a death that
					never comes.
				</p>
				<h3>🪓 The Empty Halls of Elenor</h3>

				<div id="region">
					<div id="imageFrame">
						<img style="width: 300px" src="./images/vielfall dwarves.png" />
						<small>Fig: Empty dwarven halls</small>
					</div>
					<p>
						The Dwarves of Elenor fared no better. Their engines cracked, their
						forges grew cold. The Ebony Ice they had stolen cursed their
						mountain halls. Whispers haunted the tunnels, and flame itself
						turned treacherous, burning those who struck the anvils.
						<br /><br />One by one, the Dwarves vanished into the dark. Some
						claim they were consumed by their own machines, others that they
						became stone themselves, forever bound to their broken halls. Now
						Elenor stands hollow, its gates sealed, its treasures left to dust.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3>🌳 The Scattered Wood Elves</h3>
				<p>
					The Wood Elves, proudest of all, scattered like leaves in storm. Many
					perished, undone by the very sorcery they had unleashed. Others fled
					into exile, wandering for generations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some drifted north, seeking the frost of Skjölend for refuge. Others
					crept east, hiding in forgotten groves. Only a handful endured in
					Elenor’s shadowed woods, clinging to what little remained of their
					once-great dominion.
				</p>
				<p>They remember still — and they do not forgive.</p>
				<h3>⚔️ The Last of the First Men</h3>

				<div id="region">
					<p>
						The First Men fled before the silence of the Dark Elves, their ships
						vanishing into the deep east. For centuries, they were thought lost,
						their memory fading like smoke. But the blood of the First Men
						endured <br />
						Three generations later, their descendants returned with sails ember
						like dusk, bearing iron and fire. From their line rose
						<b>House Hornn</b>, proud and fierce, the last of the First Men.
						They claimed a part of the eastern coasts of Grundwyn, and to this
						day, their banners whisper of that exile — and their vow to never
						bend knee.
					</p>
					<div id="imageFrame">
						<img style="width: 300px" src="./images/last ship.jpg" />
						<small>Fig: The last ship</small>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3>❄️ The Giants’ Lament</h3>
				<p>
					And in Skjölend, the Giants suffered though they had never joined the
					war. The world’s wounding struck even them: glaciers cracked, beasts
					vanished, storms grew endless. Slowly, the Giants dwindled. Some
					vanished into the ice, others strode into the sea and did not return.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now Skjölend inhabits, a very few sailors and adventurers who settled
					from far western fjords.
				</p>
				<h3>🌑 The Shadow of Ozvark</h3>
				<p>
					And what of the Dark Elves? They returned to their Shoals, now renamed
					<b>Ozvark</b>, named after their last high maester and the leader of
					the dark elves at war. Their gates closed for others in the world.
					They spoke no word, sent no emissaries. The Ebony Ice crystals still
					pulsed in their cliffs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The realms feared them, and in time, the fear became legend. Mothers
					told their children:
					<i
						>do not wander too far, or the Dark Elves of Ozvark will take
						you.</i
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet the truth was far darker: the Dark Elves had no need to leave. For
					the Ebony Ice still bled, and the world itself fed them.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>🌒 Thirteen Generations of Silence</h3>
				<p>
					For six hundred years after the Veilfall period, Nyvarra limped on.
					The ancient civilizations were gone, their ruins left to crumble. In
					their place rose new settlers, smugglers, pirates, and would-be kings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Houses grew from nothing — some cunning, some cruel, all eager to
					carve dominion from the bones of giants. Trade replaced empire, steel
					replaced sorcery. Yet in every hall, in every tavern, the songs of the
					War of Ash and Silence still lingered, a reminder that the shadow of
					Ozvark had not faded.
				</p>
				<p>
					And so, though the Dark Elves had not stirred for an age, all men
					feared the day they would.
				</p>
				<p>
					🔥 Thus ended the Veilfall, and thus began the
					<b>Age of the kingdoms of men</b> — weak in comparison to the
					ancients, yet reckless greedy for more power.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="today1" class="chapter">
				<h2>🦅 Grundwyn: The Hungry Realm</h2>
				<p>
					Six centuries after the Veilfall, Grundwyn rose from the ashes
					stronger than any other. It was a realm of ambition — of men who
					traded sorcery for steel, and kinship for conquest. The First Men had
					long since returned across the sea, and from their bloodline came
					House Hornn, whose strength and cunning made them the pillar of
					Grundwyn’s power.
				</p>
				<p>
					But Grundwyn was no single voice. It was a chorus of rival houses,
					each clutching at power, each hungry for dominion. They shared one
					trait above all: greed. Their hills were fertile, their ports busy,
					yet their lords whispered of more — more land, more slaves, more
					wealth.
				</p>

				<h3>The Temptation of Vornak</h3>
				<p>And so their gaze turned southward, toward <b>Vornak</b>.</p>
				<p>
					Vornak, drowned in swamps and fog, was weaker, poorer, a land where
					superstition clung like mist. Its people were mocked as swamp-born,
					yet their herbs were priceless, said to heal wounds that should kill,
					to drag men back from the threshold of death itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					To Grundwyn’s greedy houses, this was no land of mystery. It was a
					prize.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet they did not rush in blindly. They remembered well the old songs —
					of swamps that swallowed armies, of shadows that struck by night, of
					defenders who knew every reed and root. Vornak was poor, yes. But it
					was also perilous. To take it meant bleeding for every inch.
				</p>
				<h3>⚔️ A Divided Predator</h3>
				<p>
					Here lies the bitter irony: <b>Grundwyn could crush Vornak</b>, were
					its houses united. But Grundwyn is never united. Its noble families
					gnaw at each other like wolves, each scheming for the throne, each
					dreaming of glory greater than its rivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Civil war festers within its borders. Alliances are made and broken in
					a season. Blades meant for foreign foes often turn first upon kin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus Vornak survives, not by strength alone, but by the divisions of
					its enemy.
				</p>
				<h3>👑 The Warning of House Hornn</h3>
				<p>
					Only <b>House Hornn</b> remembers what unity might bring. They alone
					know the old power of the Wood Elves, for they once fought beside —
					and against — them in the War of Ash and Silence. They whisper caution
					in Grundwyn’s courts, reminding the greedy lords that Elenor’s forests
					still hide watchful eyes, that Elves do not forgive, and that war with
					them could end in ruin.
				</p>
				<p>
					But when the talk turns to Vornak, House Hornn grows silent. For they
					too know its swamps hold no vengeance but men — men who bleed, men who
					can be broken.
				</p>
				<p>
					And so the hungry lords sharpen their knives and whisper:
					<i
						>Let us take Vornak first. Its herbs, its swamps, its people. Then
						let us feast on richer prey</i
					>.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="today2" class="chapter">
				<h2>👑 The Throne of Mayholt</h2>
				<p>
					In the east of Vornak, where the swamps gave way to misty highlands
					and black oaks tangled like the fingers of the dead, stood the throne
					of the kingdom of Mayholt. It was carved not from gold or marble, but from the
					ancient heartwood of a willow tree that had withstood fire, flood, and
					famine. The people called it the <b>Weeping Throne</b> — for when the
					moonlight struck it, sap glistened like tears along its grain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon this throne sat <b>The King of Mayholt - Althar Willowen</b>, last of his line, a
					weary man whose crown weighed heavier with every passing season.
					Althar had ruled for forty years, and in those years he had seen
					Vornak bled dry by raids from Grundwyn, treachery among its own lords,
					and the endless slow death of his people’s faith.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet it was not foreign blades that haunted him most — it was time.
				</p>
				<h3>🌙 A Kingdom of Waiting</h3>
				<p>
					The King had no son, only a single daughter, the
					<b>Princess Elanora</b>. She was wed to House Renfin, a family known
					not for armies but for trade — rich, clever, and beloved in the
					markets of Dun’vahr. By law, when Althar’s breath failed, the throne
					would pass into Renfin hands.
				</p>
				<p>But not all of Mayholt’s lords bowed quietly to this fate.</p>
				<p>
					Some were patient, waiting like wolves, their eyes fixed upon the
					throne. Houses with bloodied swords and swelling militias, whispering
					that Renfin’s merchants would shame the kingdom with treaties and coin
					when what Vornak needed was war. They dreamed of seizing southern
					Grundwyn’s fertile lands, of enslaving its farmers, of building an
					empire from the bones of their enemy.
				</p>
				<p>
					And so, while his rivals plotted ambition and conquest, the King
					preached survival and peace. But peace is a fragile crown, and death
					is a patient usurper.

				<h2>🌑 House Morrath</h2>
				<p>
					In the northern swamps of Vornak, where the mists curl low and the
					willows bend heavy with sorrow, there once stood <b>House Morrath</b>.
					Wealthy merchants, lords of herbs and marshland, they were respected
					by allies and envied by rivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>The Morrath children</h3>
					<p>
						Thalen Morrath, the eldest, bore the weight of his house with honour. Brave and valorous, he had risen swiftly in the King’s army, where his sword and command earned him the loyalty of men and the envy of rivals. In him burned the fire of his forefathers, and many believed he would one day restore the Morrath name to greatness.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sylwen Morrath, the second-born, was her father’s pride. Closest to his heart, she walked the halls of Mayholt’s court with a grace and wisdom that outshone her years. Her beauty was sung of in whispers—so radiant that even the Princess herself grew envious—yet it was her keen mind for stewardship and lordship that marked her as destined for power. Many lords said in secret that she would have made the finest ruler Mayholt had ever known.
					</p>
					<p>
						Deyric Morrath, third of the line, was the largest and strongest of his kin. Yet beneath his towering frame lived a gentle spirit. He learned the arts of war from his elder brother Thalen, but his heart strayed always toward wandering roads, old songs, and the forgotten tales of distant lands. Others mocked his softness, but endurance, not steel, would one day shape his path.
					</p>
					<p>
						Meyric Morrath, the youngest, came into the world on the night his mother left it. Neglected in childhood, he grew cunning and cruel, a boy who smiled with charm but whose words carried deeper meaning. Sylwen loved her the most, and he found his lost mother in her.
					</p>
				</p>
				
				<h3>🔥 The Night of Ashes</h3>
				<p>
					Deyric’s road home was heavy with sorrow. He had wandered far as a bard, chasing old legends, guided by a tutor who filled his ears with tales of elves and dwarves. But on the shadowed slopes of Elenor’s <b>Mount Tarman</b>, the mountain claimed his teacher in a storm of stone and fire. Hardened by grief, yet still carrying the lute more readily than the sword, Deyric turned his steps back toward the swamps of Vornak, seeking the comfort of hearth and kin.
				</p>
				<p>
					But fate had saved its cruellest note for last. As he neared his family’s halls, the Morrath tragedy did not come as open war, but as <b>smoke upon the horizon</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pirates raided the eastern coast, and Lord Morrath — with his brother,
					his heir, and loyal retainers — marched to defend a fishing village.
					Bloodied, weary, and burdened with wounds, they returned victorious,
					their ships creaking under the weight of loss.
				</p>

				<div id="region">
					<div id="imageFrame">

						<small>Fig: The Slaughter of House Morrath</small>
					</div>
					<p>
						And then they saw it!!<br />
						<br />
						Their estate ablaze, towers choked in fire, banners curling into
						black ash. The cries of servants and children drowned in the roar of
						the inferno.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					From the shadows, steel glimmered. Raiders — too many, too swift, too
					well-armed to be mere bandits — fell upon them in ambush. The Morrath
					men, already broken from battle, fought like lions… but none survived.
					Lord Morrath, his brother, his son, and his household guard were all
					cut down, their blood soaking the very soil they had ruled.
				</p>
				<p>By dawn, House Morrath was thought destroyed.</p>
				<h3>🩸 The Survivors</h3>
				<p>
					Only three children escaped the slaughter: <br />
					Deyric, absent on his wanderings, spared by chance or by destiny.<br />
					Sylwen, studying stewardship at the royal court of Mayholt, far from the flames.<br />
					And Meyric, the youngest, sent with her to the academy, where he learned his letters and swordplay, untouched by the fire and steel that consumed their home.
					</p>
				<p>
					It was whispered that fate was merciful. But in Mayholt’s courts, the
					whispers were crueler:
					<i>
						<blockquote>
							“Only the bard lives, yet the house is ash. What can a singer do with a
							lord’s land?”
						</blockquote>
					</i>
				</p>
				<h3>⚖️ The King’s Gambit</h3>
				<div id="region">
					<div id="imageFrame">
						<img style="width: 400px" src="./images/whispers.png" />
						<small>Fig: Whispers</small>
					</div>
					<p>
					The rival houses circled like crows, urging the King to strip Morrath’s name from the rolls and scatter its holdings among themselves.
					<br /><br />
						<i>
						“Deyric is no lord,” they said. “He is a wanderer with a lute, not a sword. His sister is but a girl in the court, his brother a boy at lessons. Give Morrath’s wealth to those strong enough to wield it for the realm.”
						</i>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					But the King was no fool. He saw daggers behind their words. Perhaps
					he knew the Morrath tragedy was no mere pirate raid, but a plot rooted
					in envy.
				</p>
				<div id="region">
					<p>
						So he denied the rivals. Instead, he gathered all three surviving siblings and sent them far south, beyond
						their reach, and granted them a broken swamp domain called
						<b>Hollowfen</b>. A forested land at the borders of Mayholt, half-drowned in fog, long
						considered cursed — but a land nonetheless. <br />
						He exiled them together with the protection of a loyal retainer family:

							<ul>
								<li>Perdor (stalwart, loyal to the King),</li>
								<li>Inny (his wife, pragmatic and wise),</li>
								<li>Nirin (daughter, close in age to Seliora, practical and empathetic),</li>
								<li>Arin (son, mischievous but brave)</li>
							</ul>
						<br />
						<i>
							“Rebuild, House Morrath,” the King told the siblings “Prove your house is
							not ash. The swamps defend those who endure them, and perhaps you
							will find strength where others find only mud.”
						</i>
						<br/>
						<p>
							Together, by fortnight’s end, two carriages and a bullock cart carried the remnants of House Morrath through the mists of Mayholt toward Hollowfen — a cursed land, but perhaps their last refuge.
						</p>

				<h3>🏹 A Bard, A Lady, and A Boy</h3>
				<p>So began the tale of House Morrath's remnants.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Sylwen</b>, - <i>"To be at peace without fear,"</i> she tells herself in the long nights, <i>"one must be prepared for war."</i>. The scholar of lordship, became <b>Lady of Hollowfen</b> by right but by necessity. She who had walked Mayholt's courts with grace now ruled a cursed marsh with iron will. The burden of House Morrath fell upon her shoulders — to raise villages from the mire, to train militias from peasants, to carve strength from sorrow.
					<br/>
					She knows her brothers well: Deyric's growing strength and Meyric's cunning patience. She sees their paths clearly, and guides them with quiet wisdom. Yet her own vision reaches further than either realises. In her mind, she sees villages rising from the mire, trade routes spreading like veins of gold, soldiers drilling in formation, and coin flowing into Morrath's coffers. She envisions Hollowfen transformed — economically prosperous, militarily unassailable — so formidable that no house, no alliance, not even the entire kingdom would dare raise a hand against House Morrath again.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Deyric</b>, the bard who returned too late, now walks two lives. By day, he follows the path his brother <b>Thalen</b> once walked — the path of the warrior. He trains beneath <b>Perdor</b>, the King's chosen protector, a soldier whose skill matches Deyric's towering frame and whose stern demeanour echoes Thalen's patient care. Where once Deyric fled from the blade, now he embraces it, his soft hands hardening with each swing of the sword.
					<br/>
					He does not seek revenge — he seeks <b>justice</b>. There is a difference, and Deyric clings to it like a psalm. He dreams of the day when House Morrath will be strong enough to stand before those who burned his home — not as assassins in the dark, but as lords demanding answers in the light. He will rebuild their defenses, gather men loyal and true, and when the time comes, he will be the shield his family needs and the judge his enemies will face.
					<br/>
					By night, he still holds his lute, singing softer songs now — laments for what was lost, prayers for what must be protected. The wanderer has become a guardian, and beneath Perdor's watchful eye, Deyric learns what his brother always knew: that strength is not cruelty, but the will to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
				</p>				
				<p>
					<b>Meyric</b>, the youngest and most dangerous, watches with eyes that miss nothing. He was but a boy when the flames took his family, yet he is a boy no longer. Charming in court, cunning in counsel, he has marked every lord who whispered poison at Mayholt, every rival who urged the King to strip away Morrath's name and scatter its wealth like ash.
					<br/>
					He has no proof — not yet — but he knows. He feels it in his bones, hears it in their careful words. While Sylwen dreams of distant strength and Deyric trains for righteous justice, To Meyric it's straight truth: <i>"Justice served late is justice forgotten"</i>. The longer they wait, the colder the trail grows, the bolder their enemies become, the more House Morrath fades into a cautionary tale whispered by firelight.
					<br/>
					By day, he serves his sister with devotion, helping raise their small homestead in Hollowfen under her warm grace and wisdom. He smiles, he bows, he plays the loyal brother. But in the dark hours, he sharpens more than steel. He gathers whispers, tracks movements, builds networks of eyes and ears. When the moment comes — and it will come soon, before memory fades and enemies grow comfortable — he will strike so cruelly and precisely that every lord in Mayholt will know what House Morrath is a house to fear.
					<br/>
					Not mercy. Not forgiveness. Only the kind of fear that makes men wake screaming, knowing that the boy they dismissed has become their reckoning.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					In Hollowfen, House Morrath must raise villages from the mire, train militias
					from peasants, and carve strength from sorrow.
				</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					The journey begins with little: a homestead built from local timber, a handful of loyal retainers, and people slowly joining — refugees, wanderers, those seeking a second chance in the mists of Hollowfen. From these humble foundations, House Morrath will rise again.<br /><br />
					
					But the question remains: <br />
					Who truly burned House Morrath? <br />
					It wasn't merely pirates from across the sea — the grasping hands of rival lords were involved. But which ones? How deep does the conspiracy run? <br />
					And when the truth is finally uncovered, will it destroy the siblings… or forge them into something greater — perhaps the saviours of Vornak itself?
					<br />
